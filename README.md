# Plan-IT-V1.0

This is the most recent and up to date version of the Planner Application using the Planner API. This newest version correctly implements serialization for each of the objects of the Planner to save/open individual .pln (planner) files in their special format. Features include the following:

1. 3 Main different views - Daily, Weekly, and Monthly, that offer different ways of adding events and viewing a day's tasks.
2. Saving/Opening of planner files so that Planners can be used after the program has closed.
3. Easy-access start page to get the user started quickly, with continue and recent file support.
4. Support for both Hourly events and all day events, with the ability to delete or mark as completed.

Some of the further features that may be added include color themes, preferences, moving of events across days, overhaul of the weekly view, and additional features not listed here.

This application also uses the Planner API, a set of tools for using and manipulating a Planner Object. This object includes about 60 functions for getting data into and from the planner object. This API will be released as a separate project sometime in the near future.
